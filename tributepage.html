          <h2>General Information</h2>
          <p id="info">Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely considered one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Although best known for developing the <strong>theory of relativity</strong>, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics. Einstein received the 1921 <i>Nobel Prize in Physics</i> for the discovery of the <strong>photoelectric effect</strong>.</p>

          <h2>Albert Einstein's timeline</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1879</strong> - Albert Einstein is born in Ulm, German Empire.</li>
            <li><strong>1896</strong> - Enrolls in a four-year mathematics and physics program at the <i>Federal polytechnic school</i> in Zürich.</li>
            <li><strong>1900</strong> - Receives his Federal teaching diploma after completing the mathematics and physics program.</i> </li>
            <li><strong>1903</strong> - Marries his first wife, Mileva Marić, who he met while completing his college diploma.</li>
            <li><strong>1905</strong> - Publishes 4 scientific papers pertaining to the<i> photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity and matter-energy equivalence</i> (the famous E=mc2 equation was created here).</li>
            <li><strong>1907-1915</strong> - Developes the General relativity theory, wich completed his previous work on Special relativity. Predicted the phenomena of<i> gravitational time dilation, gravitational waves, gravitational redshift and deflection of light.</i></li>
            <li><strong>1919</strong> - After divorcing his first wife, Einstein marries Elsa Löwenthal, his first cousin maternally, and second cousin paternally, who dies in 1936 after being diagnosed with heart and kidney problems a year earlier.</li>
            <li><strong>1921-1922</strong> - Starts a series of travel, wich took him to the US, England, Singapore, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Japan, Palestine and Spain. Gives several public lectures and visites renowned universities.</li>
            <li><strong>1922</strong> - Receives the 1921 Nobel Prize in physics <q>for his services to Theoretical Physics, and specially fos his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect</q>.</li>
            <li><strong>1925</strong> - Visits South America. Spends a month in Argenina, a week in Uruguay and a week in Brazil.</li>
            <li><strong>1930-1931</strong> - Visits the US for the second time. Albert was taken to multiple places and events, including Chinatown, a performance of<i> Carmen</i> at the Metropolitan Opera, Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration, and joined Charli Chaplin as his special guests during Chaplin's <i>City Lights</i> premiere.</li>
            <li><strong>1933</strong> - Einstein emigrates to the US after renouncing to his German citizenship when the Nazis rose to power under Adolf Hitler's direction.</li>
            <li><strong>1935</strong> - In collaboration with Natan Rosen, Einstein produces a model of a wormhole, also called "Einstein-Rosen bridges".</li>
            <li><strong>1950</strong> - Attemps to generalize his theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity, a Unified field theory. Although unsuccessful, his work has motivated modern quests for a <i>theory of everything</i>, in particular <i>string theory</i>.</li>
            <li id="last-li"><strong>1953</strong> - Dies at the age of 76 on 17 april after experiencing internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurism. Refused surgery, saying: <q>I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share; it is time to go. I will do it elegantly</q>.</li>
